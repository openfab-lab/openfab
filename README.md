OpenFab is an open source project. That means anybody can view, use, modify, distribute but also [contribute](#contributing) to what we are doing. These permissions are enforced through an open source license, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) in our case.

Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly. Every experience, iteration, either it's a success or a fail is documented and could be used by anyone to go further. This way, as said Mandela, we never lose: we win or we learn. 

## Values

3 main values guide us in our exploration:

- Collaboration.  
At OpenFab, we collaborate by nature, we are pooling of machines (3D printers, laser-cutter, CNC, ...). We are sharing our thoughts to go further, to find our answers. Plus, the more we are the more fun we have.

- Iteration.  
As said Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn : "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late." There are no perfect answer to our questions.  Let's try and see what happens, will do better next time.

- Empowerment.  
OpenFab is a tool for the community that empowers its members: production means, trainings, learning from peers, ... It's a virtuous spiral, the community makes members greater which in return makes the community better and so forth.
